# BACKPACK Mobile App

mobile app created with react-native `Expo-CLI` using all key features like redux,`context`,`navigation`,`networking` and styling.


All the data is dynamically genrated as app is connected with backend made with node although app is not 100% completed  as some features or pages are still in development phase but for the most part app is ready to use.
Here we tap into native device like `localStorage` of the phone to store login status and `local-notification`.
